# sum-of-sales-test

## Summary
This web application was auto-generated by an LLM based on the following brief:
> Publish a single-page site that fetches data.csv from attachments, sums its sales column, displays the total inside an element with id #total-sales.

It has been modified to also display a Bootstrap table (`#product-sales`) listing each product with its individual sales, and the total sales in `#total-sales` remains accurate.
